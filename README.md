# OAK-D-PoE-Camera-HTTP-Server
For Use With An Oak-D PoE Camera, runs a HTTP Server on the OAK-D which streams footage from the main colour camera in 60fps 

1Gb/s Network Required For 60fps, 100Mb/s will only allow 10-20fps

Recomend only one client connect to the http server at a time, as multiple clients will drastically affect the performance of the camera.

For this project, the HTTP stream was connected to a Synology RackStation with Surveillance Station to view and record the footage.
